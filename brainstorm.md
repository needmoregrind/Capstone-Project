# Brainstorming Notes - BudgetBuddy

## Problem
Many people struggle to manage their finances because they don’t have a simple, mobile way to log expenses and track income. Existing apps are either too complex or require subscriptions.

## Solution
BudgetBuddy is a minimal, user-friendly app that helps users track income and expenses. It provides insights into spending patterns and helps promote better financial habits.

## Target Users
- College students managing tight budgets
- Young professionals new to personal finance
- Anyone who wants a lightweight finance tracker without ads or subscriptions

## Core Features
- Add/Edit/Delete income and expense transactions
- Monthly budget summary
- Visualizations of spending vs. income
- Persistent local storage
- Optional reminders to log daily expenses

## Why this idea?
It solves a real problem I face. I want to build something that I can actually use—and possibly publish.
